- title: "InfiniCache: Exploiting Ephemeral Serverless Functions to Build a Cost-Effective Memory Cache"
  image: infinicache_arch.png
  description: "We design and implement InfiniCache, a first-of-its-kind
in-memory object caching system that is completely built and deployed
atop ephemeral serverless functions.  InfiniCache exploits and
orchestrates serverless functions' memory resources to enable elastic
pay-per-use caching. InfiniCache's design combines erasure coding,
intelligent billed duration control, and an efficient data backup
mechanism to maximize data availability and cost effectiveness while
balancing the risk of losing cached state and performance."

  description: "We thoroughly investigate the problem space of DAG
scheduling in serverless computing. We identify and evaluate a set of
techniques to make DAG schedulers serverless-aware. These techniques
have been implemented in WUKONG, a serverless, DAG scheduler
prototype attuned to AWS Lambda."

control plane for distributed management and the data plane for local
data store. BESPOKV takes as input a single-server KV store, called a
datalet, and transparently enables a scalable and fault-tolerant
distributed KV store service. The resulting distributed stores are
also adaptive to consistency or topology requirement changes and can
be easily extended for new types of services. "

<u>B</u>alancing, which supports not only horizontal (scale-out) but
vertical (scale-up) scalability as well. MBal is able to make
efficient use of available resources in the cloud through its
fine-grained, partitioned, lockless design. This design also lends
itself naturally to provide adaptive load balancing both within a
server and across the cache cluster through an event-driven,
